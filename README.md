# Employee Manager

This is a CLI application that uses node and mysql to maintain a database and allow users to easily interact with and update information stored in the database.

Upon startup, the application gives a logo and then asks the user if they would like to view all information, add specific information, view specific information, update an employee's role, or exit the program.

When the user chooses to view all employee data they are able to view all relevant information about the employee across multiple mySQL data tables.

When the user chooses to add or view specific information, they are taken to a subsection of choices where they can select exactly what information they would like to view. A full demonstration of these features can be seen in the video.
